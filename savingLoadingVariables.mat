% When you close MATLAB, the workspace will be cleared. MAT-files can be used to save your variables. The variables can then be loaded into the workspace when you reopen MATLAB.
% If you want to load or save only some of your variables, you can use two inputs to the functions.

% The file myData.mat contains multiple variables. It was previously created for this further practice. Try loading just the variable k:
>> load myData k

% Then try saving the variable k to a new MAT-file called justk.mat:
>> save justk k
