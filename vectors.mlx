% Creating Vectors
% Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

% Task 1
x = 4


% Task 2
x = [7 9]
x = [7,9]

% Task 3
x = [7;9]


% Task 4
x = [3 10 5]
x = [3,10,5]

% Task 5
x = [8;2;-4]


% Task 6
x = [5,6,7;8,9,10]


% Task 7
x = [sqrt(10),pi^2]


% Further Practice
x = [7,1,8;4,5,8;10,4,2]
