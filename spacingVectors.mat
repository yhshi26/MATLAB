% Creating Evenly-Spaced Vectors
% Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

% Task 1
x = [1 2 3]


% Task 2
x = [1:4]
x = [1,2,3,4]


% Task 3
x = [1:0.5:5]


% Task 4
x = [3:2:13]


% Task 5
x = linspace(1,10,5)


% Task 6
x = x'


% Task 7
x = [5:2:9]'


% Further Practice
x = linspace(1,2*pi,100)
